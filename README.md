# VRChat-Friends-List-Cleaner
VRChat Friend Cleaner (Full GUI) is a Python-based automation tool that lets you easily manage and declutter your VRChat friends list. It automatically scrapes your full friend list from the VRChat website, detects inactivity based on “Last Seen” timestamps, and allows you to safely unfriend inactive users through an intuitive graphical interface.

The tool supports Dry Run testing, automatic CSV backups, resume support (so you never lose progress), and full control over thresholds and speed. Designed for convenience, transparency, and safety — no credentials are stored or transmitted anywhere.
